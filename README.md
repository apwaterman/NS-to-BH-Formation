# NS to BH Formation

This is the final project I chose to do for my Relativistic Astrophysics and Cosmology class.

I was given free reign to do anything I wanted as long as it was in line with what was used in the class.


Neutron stars in dark matter halos can accrete asymmetric dark matter particles into their core. 

Over time, as dark matter accumulates, it becomes self-gravitating and forms a nascent black hole within the neutron starâ€™s core. This black hole then absorbs the neutron star, effectively consuming it. This process demonstrates a potential mechanism for black hole formation from neutron stars due to non-annihilating or asymmetric dark matter accretion. 

I have analyzed some parameters for many neutron stars throughout our galaxy and have simulated what this process might look like.

C161ProjectAnalysis.ipynb explains the various parameters I used. \
Note: This project is theoretical and does NOT use any recorded data.

I have provided some gifs showing the simulation, but feel free to create your own using C161ProjectBHCollapseSim.ipynb

My main resource is a paper from the University of Michigan published in 2012, titled "Constraints on asymmetric dark matter from black hole formation in neutron stars."
